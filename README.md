# just another sourdough calculator

i started making my own sourdough bread (thanks covid) and wanted to practice some beginner react in my spare time.

so the first thing i'm making is a simple sourdough calculator app.

i did some research on some popular sourdough ratios out there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arQHlimoQ7mk31QW3pKOMuSh2wwqXMCLChit9JuMpEM/edit?usp=sharing

and set up a lil trello board, for fun really: https://trello.com/b/RKfL2fQM/bread-calc

the "live" version is hosted on netlify: https://sourdghcalc.netlify.app/
